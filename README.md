# 2.【How to Play】

Your mission: 

The game of Hanoi Tower is presumably no stranger to players. The game is to move the pyramid on the left to the far right, the big square can not be placed on the small square, move all the squares on the left to the far right, and the minimum number of steps can challenge the success.
